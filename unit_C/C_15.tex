\Exercise[number={15}]
In a binary classification problem, starting from a feature vector \(x\),
the linear discriminant vector \(w\) was obtained such that \(z=w^Tx\)
and the two classes in \(z\) are 'maximally separated' (linear
discriminant analysis, LDA). Suppose that a linear transformation is
applied to \(x: x'=Hx\) where \( H x\) is a diagonal matrix. Let \(w'\) be 
the discriminant vector for the new feature vector \(x'\).
What is the relationship between \(w\) and \(w'\)?
